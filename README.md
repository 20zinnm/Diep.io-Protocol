# About
A project to decipher the protocol diep.io uses to communicate, in hopes of creating our own server.

# Getting Started
First, read up on the game protocol in the wiki "Protocol" page in order to familiarize 
yourself with the basics of diep.io communcation. Everything we have learned so far
is stored in the wiki, and reading it will allow you a headstart in developing your own
server, understanding the game protocol, or doing anything you wish with the game.

Then, you can start using the provided Chrome extension to start reading and modifying 
the game packets yourself. The extension is stored in the `chrome_ext` directory, and
a `README` is included in that directory. There's even a wiki page if you want more
information.

**If you discover anything interesting or have anything you can contribute, please consider
adding it to the wiki!** A pull request will allow you to make changes to code or wiki pages.
