# About
A project to decipher the protocol diep.io uses to communicate, in hopes of creating our own server.

# Getting Started
First, read up on the game protocol in the wiki "Protocol" page in order to familiarize 
yourself with the basics of diep.io communcation.

Then, you can start using the provided Chrome extension to start reading and modifying 
the game packets yourself. The extension is stored in the `chrome_ext` directory, and
a README is included (as well as a Wiki page about) that directory. 

**If you discover anything interesting or have anything you can contribute, please consider
adding it to the wiki!** A pull request will allow you to make changes to code or wiki pages.
