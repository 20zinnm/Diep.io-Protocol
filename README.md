# About
This project aims to decipher the protocol diep.io uses to communicate, in hopes of 
creating our own server eventually or doing interesting things with the game. Please
visit the project Wiki (that is where all the protocol information is stored).

# Getting Started
First, read up on the game protocol in the wiki "Protocol" page in order to familiarize 
yourself with the basics of diep.io communication. Everything we have learned so far
is stored in the wiki, and reading it will allow you a headstart in developing your own
server, understanding the game protocol, or doing anything you wish with the game.

Then, you can start using the provided Chrome extension to start reading and modifying 
the game packets yourself. The extension is stored in the `chrome_ext` directory, and
a `README` is included in that directory. There's even a wiki page if you want more
information.

# How To Contribute
**If you discover anything interesting or have anything you can contribute, please consider
adding it to the wiki!** A pull request will allow you to make changes to code or wiki pages.
